# Titanic-Datascience-Project
 

The notebook walks us through a typical workflow for solving data science competitions at sites like Kaggle.

# Question

- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.
- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

# Steps
 - Please download the dataset from [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and copy to [input/](input/)
 - Install python requirements using pip `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Run the notebook
